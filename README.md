# DivePlay

A browser-based media player that lives in your folders and works with your local files.
Available in two versions: a portable **Web Player** and a powerful **Desktop App**.

## 🚀 Two Ways to Play

| Version | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Web (HTML)** | A single, portable HTML file. No installation required. | Basic H.264/AAC files, portability. |
| **Desktop (Tauri)** | Full application with integrated **FFmpeg** codecs. | MKV, HEVC, AC3, DTS, and high-bitrate files. |

> 💡 **Desktop Advantage:** The Desktop version automatically transcodes unsupported codecs (like AC3 audio or HEVC video) on-the-fly, allowing you to play almost any media file without manual conversion.

## How It Works

### 📂 Folder Scan & Auto-Playlist

When you open a folder, DivePlay **scans all files inside it** and automatically builds a playlist with every supported media file found. Files are listed in the sidebar and play sequentially by default.

### 🔀 Playback Order

You can switch the playback mode at any time using the controls in the player:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Sequential** | Plays files in alphabetical order, one after another |
| **Shuffle** | Randomizes the playlist order |
| **Loop All** | Repeats the entire playlist indefinitely |

### ⏱️ Resume Where You Left Off

DivePlay automatically saves your progress to a `.player-state.json` file inside the media folder. Next time you open the same folder, it offers to **resume from exactly where you stopped** — including the current file, timestamp, volume, and playback settings.

> 💡 This feature requires Chrome or Edge (browsers that support the File System Access API).

## Supported Browsers

- **Chrome / Edge** (recommended): Full features including folder selection and state persistence
- **Firefox / Safari**: Limited - select individual files, no state saving

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a Chromium browser
2. Select a folder with your media
3. Click any file to play

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Space | Play/Pause |
| ← → | Seek -10s / +10s |
| ↑ ↓ | Volume |
| F | Fullscreen |
| M | Mute |

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Output in `dist/`.

## Limitations

### Codec Support

DivePlay's compatibility depends on whether you are using the Web version (limited by browser decoders) or the Desktop App (enhanced by FFmpeg):

| Format / Codec | Web (HTML) | Desktop (App) | Notes |
|----------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **H.264 / AAC** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Universal compatibility |
| **H.265 / HEVC** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Works | App transcodes to H.264 on-the-fly |
| **AC3 / EAC3** | ❌ No | ✅ Works | App transcodes to AAC on-the-fly |
| **DTS / TrueHD** | ❌ No | ✅ Works | App transcodes to AAC on-the-fly |
| **MKV Container**| ⚠️ Spotty | ✅ Works | App handles MKV via streaming |
| **VP9 / Opus** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Well supported in modern browsers |
| **AV1** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Modern open format |
